# Introduction
In software engineering, we have clear methodologies and frameworks - Agile, Scrum, etc. - that bring order and structure to working methodologies and how we build; 
Yet when it comes to recruitment and interviews, the process remains chaotic, inconsistent, and often unfair. It is still a "wild west", where candidates face unclear expectations, arbitrary practices, and power imbalances.

The **Fair Interview Treaty (FIT)** seeks to establish a shared framework of principles for conducting interviews with clarity, respect, and professionalism. These guidelines are not rigid rules, but a code of fairness: designed to protect candidates from harm, describe fair standards and and empower interviewers with structure and guidelines allowing them to conduct interviews in a clear, effective way, eventually helping companies find the most suitable candidates and build stronger teams.
Adoption is voluntary, but visible:
Companies can declare alignment with **FIT** by stating it in their job descriptions, signaling a commitment to fair recruitment practices.
Candidates can testify whether their experience reflected **FIT** principles, providing accountability and feedback (e.g. to external HR agencies or through social media).

The goal of **FIT** is simple: to transform recruitment from a chaotic filter into a fair, humane, and reliable process — one that honors the skills, dignity, and time of every participant.

## Pre Interview

### Role Description
A fair interview begins with a clear and truthful description of the role;
- **Defined Responsibilities**: The company must outline the responsibilities and expected scope of work without vagueness or misdirection.
- **Domain Boundaries**: While tech roles often overlap, the core domains should be specified in advance:

Suggested domain segmentation for Web Development**
* Front-End Engineering: user interfaces, client-side performance, browser technologies.
* Back-End Engineering: server-side logic, APIs, databases (query optimizations), system integrations.
- Operations (DevOps / Cloud): Infrastructure, deployment pipelines, monitoring, observability, scalability.
- Data Engineering / Data Science: analytics, ML models, pipelines, business intelligence.
- Cross-Cutting Practices (explicitly state whether they are expected responsibilities or handled by other teams):
  * Testing (unit, integration, end-to-end, automation).
  * CI/CD (continuous integration, deployment pipelines, release management).
  * Security & Compliance (vulnerability management, access controls).

- Transparency in Mix: If the role combines domains (e.g., full-stack, frontend+ops, backend+data), the weighting should be communicated — e.g.: > "70% front-end, 30% backend."


Candidate Respect: Candidates should not be judged against expectations that were never communicated.
