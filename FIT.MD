# Introduction
In software engineering, we have clear methodologies and frameworks - Agile, Scrum, etc. - that bring order and structure to working methodologies and how we build; 
Yet when it comes to recruitment and interviews, the process remains chaotic, inconsistent, and often unfair. It is still a "wild west", where candidates face unclear expectations, arbitrary practices, and power imbalances.

The **Fair Interview Treaty (FIT)** seeks to establish a shared framework of principles for conducting interviews with clarity, respect, and professionalism. These guidelines are not rigid rules, but a code of fairness: designed to protect candidates from harm, describe fair standards and and empower interviewers with structure and guidelines allowing them to conduct interviews in a clear, effective way, eventually helping companies find the most suitable candidates and build stronger teams.
Adoption is voluntary, but visible:
Companies can declare alignment with **FIT** by stating it in their job descriptions, signaling a commitment to fair recruitment practices.
Candidates can testify whether their experience reflected **FIT** principles, providing accountability and feedback (e.g. to external HR agencies or through social media).

The goal of **FIT** is simple: to transform recruitment from a chaotic filter into a fair, humane, and reliable process — one that honors the skills, dignity, and time of every participant.

# 1. Pre Interview

## 1.1 Role Description
A fair interview begins with a clear and truthful description of the role;

### Defined Responsibilities 
The company must outline the responsibilities and expected scope of work without vagueness or misdirection.

### Domain Boundaries 
While tech roles often overlap, the core domains should be specified in advance

#### Suggested domains segmentation for Web Development roles
* **Front-End Engineering**: user interfaces, client-side performance, browser technologies.
* **Back-End Engineering**: server-side logic, APIs, databases (query optimizations), system integrations.
* **Operations (DevOps / Cloud)**: Infrastructure, deployment pipelines, monitoring, observability, scalability.
* **Data Engineering / Data Science**: analytics, ML models, pipelines, business intelligence.
* **Cross-Cutting Practices** (explicitly state whether they are expected responsibilities or handled by other teams):
  - Testing (unit, integration, end-to-end, automation).
  - CI/CD (continuous integration, deployment pipelines, release management).
  - Security & Compliance (vulnerability management, access controls).

#### Transparency in Mix 
If the role combines domains (e.g.: full-stack, frontend+ops, backend+data), the weighting should be communicated, e.g.: 
> "70% front-end, 30% backend".

#### Candidate Respect
Candidates should not be judged against expectations that were never communicated.

# 2. Interview

## 2.1 Stress, Wellness and Psychological Safety
A fair interview acknowledges that interviews are inherently stressful environments and that performance under stress does not fully reflect a candidate’s professional capabilities.

### Stress Distortion
Nervousness, hesitation, or small slips may occur under pressure. These should not be mistaken for lack of competence or depth.

### Adjustment Time
Allow the candidate a few minutes to settle in. Do not rush straight into high-stakes problem solving without orientation.

✅ Start with lighter context-setting questions. <br>
✅ Briefly explain the structure of the interview at the beginning.

### Creating Comfort
- Small efforts to reduce anxiety can unlock more authentic performance:
- Offering water or a short pause.
- Allowing time for note-taking or whiteboard setup.
- Acknowledging that "It’s normal to think aloud" or "take your time."

### Interpretation with Care

❌ “The candidate was hesitant — they must lack confidence.” <br>
✅ “The candidate was initially nervous but warmed up as the discussion progressed.”

### Principle of Humanity
Remember that the interview is not a natural professional environment. It is artificial and asymmetric. A fair interviewer actively works to bridge the gap, helping the candidate show their true abilities.

## 2.2 Question Clarity and Fair Framing
A fair interview respects the balance between abstraction and specificity, and ensures questions are purposeful, clear, and aligned with engineering reality.

### Avoid Vagueness 
Questions should not be overly broad or undefined;


> ❌ "Tell me about design." <br>
> ✅ "Which design pattern would you use to solve this concurrency problem, and why?"

If an interviewer feels an answer is out of the scope of the question - mention it, and gently try to guide the candidate back to the real scope; Example:
> "That’s a good point about distributed queues. For this problem though, let’s keep it in a single-node context - how would you design it then?".

### Avoid Trivial Trivia Questions should not hinge on obscure, easily searchable facts that don’t demonstrate reasoning or engineering skills;

> ❌ "What is the exact CLI flag for disabling XYZ in Docker?" <br>
> ✅ "How would you approach debugging a container that fails to start?"

### Balanced Spectrum
Interviewers must recognize the difference between answers that are too abstract or too specific, and guide the candidate accordingly.

* If an answer is too abstract → ask: 
> "Can you give a concrete example?:

* If an answer is too specific → ask: 
> "Can you zoom out and explain the broader principle?"


### Encourage Curiosity 
Candidates asking clarifying questions should be seen as demonstrating professional thinking, not ignorance;
Especially for senior engineers, questions are a way of scoping the problem space. Their mental model is wide, so they must "prism in" toward the relevant context and scope.

### Clarity of Expectations
Communicate what kind of answer you’re seeking (conceptual, architectural, implementation detail) before judging the response.

## 2.3 Fair Problem Presentation and Humane Dialogue
A fair interview is not an interrogation but a professional dialogue between colleagues.

### Clarity in Problem Statements
When presenting a programming or algorithmic challenge, the interviewer must clearly define the problem, inputs, outputs, and constraints. Ambiguity should be minimized, and candidates should be encouraged to ask clarifying questions.

### Respect Different Journeys
Even within the same field, no two engineers share the same path. Candidates may arrive at solutions through different frameworks, mental models, or experiences. These differences should be welcomed as diversity of thought, not treated as deviation from a “textbook” path.

### Beyond Trivia
The purpose of technical questions is to assess reasoning and problem-solving, not to extract textbook phrases or obscure trivia.

### Seek Strengths, Not Conformity
 Every candidate has strengths. The interviewer’s role is to discover and surface them, then assess whether they align with the role - not to force the candidate into a pre-shaped mold.

### Humility of the Interviewer
An interviewer does not, and cannot, know everything. If a candidate introduces a concept, tool, or perspective unfamiliar to the interviewer, the fair response is to admit it, remain open, and use the moment to observe how the candidate explains and teaches. This can reveal valuable collaboration skills — and create a genuine opportunity for shared learning.

### Colleague, not Gatekeeper
The interview should be conducted as a conversation between peers exploring a technical subject. It is not a performance stage, nor a power trip. Fairness means listening, engaging, and co-reasoning.


## 2.4 Respecting Depth, Avoiding Trivialization
A fair interview recognizes that the level of questioning signals respect for the candidate’s experience.

### Basic Questions
Fundamental, or “trivial” questions can serve as quick sanity checks - to ensure shared baseline knowledge and communication.

#### Use Sparingly 
Such questions should be brief, limited, and only in early stages of the process. They are not the substance of a senior interview.

#### Insult by Repetition 
Once it is clear that the candidate passes the sanity check, continuing to linger in the trivial realm is insulting, demotivating, and signals distrust of their competence.

#### Impact on Candidates
Some seniors may become defensive, some may quietly swallow the insult; Both reactions are legitimate - but both are avoidable if the interviewer respects depth.

### Calibrate to Seniority
For experienced candidates, the main interview should focus on systemic reasoning, architectural trade-offs, debugging approaches, leadership in engineering decisions - not rote syntax or boilerplate knowledge.

### Principle of Progression
Interview depth should naturally progress once the baseline is established. A fair interview moves forward, it does not loop endlessly in trivia.

## 3. Post Interview
### 3.1 Home Assignments
A fair interview ensures that home assignments are reasonable, relevant, and respectful of the candidate’s time.

#### Right Scope
Assignments must not simulate building entire products;
❌ “Build a full e-commerce platform". 

They should focus on specific skills relevant to the role; 
✅ "Implement a product listing component with filtering and sorting".

#### Clarity of Demands
The requirements must be clearly written and free from hidden expectations. Ambiguity wastes candidate time and creates unfair evaluation.

#### Respect for Time
Assignments should be appropriately timed:
* A short “demo exercise” (≤2 hours) may be acceptable - if demands are shown in advance so candidates can plan.
* Longer assignments must allow realistic time (a few days, with flexibility for employed candidates).

#### Not a Test of Endurance
Overly short time limits (e.g. “do this in 90 minutes”) test robotic speed under pressure, not professional skill. Real engineers think, design, test, and revise — they are not code-generating machines.

#### Relevance to Role
Every assignment must connect directly to the responsibilities of the role. Off-topic or boilerplate tasks disrespect both candidate and interviewer time.

#### Principle of Proportionality
The effort requested should be proportional to the stage of the process. Early screening ≠ multi-day projects. 
Depth should increase only as mutual interest grows.

### 3.1 Feedback
A fair interview demands language that is professional, neutral, and free from ad hominem judgment.
#### No Personal Labels
Feedback must never reduce a candidate to personality traits or sweeping judgments.

> ❌ “You come across as arrogant."
> ✅ “When asked about scaling, your response focused on implementation details but did not address system-level trade-offs.”

#### Describe Behavior, Not Identity
Language should reference what was observed in the interview context, not imply a fixed trait of the person.

> ❌ “You are not a deep thinker.”
> ✅ “In the debugging exercise, the exploration stayed on surface symptoms without moving toward root cause analysis.”

#### Avoid Absolutes
Statements like “You always…” or “You never…” are unfair and inaccurate. Instead, specify the particular instance.

> ❌ “You never answer directly.”
> ✅ “In the API design question, you first gave an abstract explanation without a concrete example. Asking for both might have strengthened your answer.”

#### Respect in Feedback:
Whether verbal or written, feedback should remain constructive, situational, and tied to the requirements of the role — never to personal worth or identity.

#### Principle of Humanity:
Candidates are professionals, not students being graded. Respectful language ensures dignity and fairness, even when declining.
